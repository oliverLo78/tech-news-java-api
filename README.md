The benefits of Spring Boot firsthand as you code the back end of a social news website. You've built something like this before, including capabilities for users to create accounts, post links to interesting articles, and upvote or comment on other users' posts.

3. Click the user agreement and scroll to the bottom, then check the box accepting the agreement.

4. Sign in to your Oracle account.

5. Run the install file.

6. On the first setup page, click Install, as shown in the following image:

9. Once again, choose the installation directory.

10. Click Next. When the Complete page appears, you've successfully installed Java!

2. Download the Community Edition.

3. Run the install file.

4. On the first setup page, choose Next.

5. Select the destination folder and click Next.

6. Mark the "Update PATH variable option", create the ".java" association, and click Next.

7. Click Install.

8. Choose your preferred option for when to reboot.

9. Once you've rebooted, launch IntelliJ.

10. Accept the Privacy Policy and continue.

11. This final step is left to your own discretion. You can either choose to send usage statistics or choose the "Don't send" option to keep from sharing data.

Great work. You've installed IntelliJ IDEA! Note that on the first launch of IntelliJ IDEA, it will ask you to choose some settings. In the bottom left of that screen, choose the Set Defaults option.
